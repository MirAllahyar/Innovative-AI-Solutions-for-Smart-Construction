        {/* Section 1: Virtual and Augmented Reality */}
        <div className="article-section">
          <div className="section-content">
            <h2>1. Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR)</h2>
            <p>
            Among the new construction technologies, virtual and augmented reality have been a great innovation, providing visualizations. With the $8 trillion forecast in the industry's global growth by 2030, the use of VR and AR would surely be significant. Having mentioned the possibility of a 90 percent reduction in building costs when implemented in 2022, AR/VR technology has been seen in various remote site inspections. It also enables safety, collaboration and communication among AEC personnel.

            <h2>2. Drones</h2>
            <p>
            Drones have been used in construction for over a decade. In 2023 and beyond, expect more sophisticated and AI-oriented drones. With real-time aerial imagery and 3D lidar scans, drones are revolutionizing construction procedures.
              Drones are rapidly becoming essential in construction for their ability to conduct aerial surveys and inspections. They provide real-time data, monitor progress, and ensure safety by reducing the need for manual checks in hazardous areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, drones can map large areas quickly and create accurate 3D models of construction sites, saving time and costs.

            <h2>3. Building Information Modeling (BIM)</h2>
            <p>
            BIM is another fast-rising innovative technology in construction across the globe. It is a crucial tool for modern architectural, engineering and building processes. With good interoperability, this technology allows for the creation of one or more precise digital models of buildings.
              BIM facilitates collaborative project management by creating a centralized digital model of the project. It integrates all aspects of the design, from architecture to mechanical and structural systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              This allows teams to coordinate seamlessly, predict construction timelines, and reduce errors that might arise during the building process.

            <h2>4. 3D Printing</h2>
            <p>
            3D printing, although not as widespread as BIM, is one of the newest technologies in the construction industry. Its mechanism, which involves making three-dimensional buildings from digital models, was first used in 1995. In 2023, the current trend includes creating 3D models via 3D software programs.
              3D printing is revolutionizing construction by enabling the creation of complex structures with unprecedented precision. It significantly reduces material waste, lowers construction costs, and accelerates project timelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              From small-scale prototypes to large-scale housing, 3D printing is making construction more innovative and sustainable.

            <h2>5. Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
            <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the construction industry by streamlining processes and improving efficiency. AI-powered technologies such as predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms are helping project managers make more informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and minimize risks.</p>
<p>
Robotics and automation have become integral to construction projects, enhancing productivity and safety on-site. Self-driving vehicles are transporting materials, drones are conducting inspections, and robotic arms are assisting with repetitive tasks. These advancements not only increase speed but also reduce human error while ensuring worker well-being.
